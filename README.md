# CK2_db_project
A personal project to create a database of all possible starts in Crusader Kings 2 with a simple web interface. 

This project started when I decided to start a new campaign of Crusader Kings 2. The game offers thousands of possible starting sittuations letting you play as various fuedal lords of Eurasia and Northern Africa over the span of centuries. Despite this huge selection of possible choices though I realized there was no real resource that collected them for players to browse easily.

## Current status:
* Python to extract information to json format completed
* Python to export json files to SQLite database completed
